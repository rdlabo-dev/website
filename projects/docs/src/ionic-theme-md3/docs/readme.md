DEMO is here: https://ionic-theme-md3.rdlabo.dev/

## Overview

This library provides CSS/JS files that bring the Material Design 3 design system to Ionic applications. It updates the look and feel of Ionic components to match the latest Material Design 3 guidelines.

This project aims to follow the core concepts of Ionic as closely as possible, while placing a strong emphasis on compatibility with `@rdlabo/ionic-theme-ios26`. Just as Ionic provides beautiful styling whether it displays the ios or md theme from a single HTML structure, our goal is to ensure that this theme and `@rdlabo/ionic-theme-ios26` are fully compatible.

If you don't know about `@rdlabo/ionic-theme-ios26`, you should definitely give it a try!

> **Note:** This theme is purpose-built for compatibility with Ionic's design approach and `@rdlabo/ionic-theme-ios26`; it is not intended as a strict, full MD3 recreation.


## Quick start

After [Installation](#installation), import the theme CSS and set `navAnimation` as shown below.

## Installation

This is a CSS theme for extending your Ionic project. It does not work on its own, so use it together with the Ionic Framework.

```bash
npm install @rdlabo/ionic-theme-md3
```

Note: **If you use @ionic/core@ < 8.8.0**, use @rdlabo/ionic-theme-md3@1.0.2.

And import the theme in your project's main CSS file (e.g., `src/styles.scss`).

```css
@import '@rdlabo/ionic-theme-md3/dist/css/default-variables.css';
@import '@rdlabo/ionic-theme-md3/dist/css/ionic-theme-md3.css';
```

Next, configure the animations for MD3. Add the following to your Ionic configuration options.

```ts
import { isPlatform } from '@ionic/core'; // or @ionic/angular/standalone, @ionic/react, @ionic/vue
import { mdTransitionAnimation } from '@rdlabo/ionic-theme-md3';

// Angular
provideIonicAngular({
    ...
    navAnimation: isPlatform('ios') ? undefined: mdTransitionAnimation,
});

// React
setupIonicReact({
    ...
    navAnimation: isPlatform('ios') ? undefined: mdTransitionAnimation,
});

// Vue
createApp(App)
    .use(IonicVue, {
        ...
        navAnimation: isPlatform('ios') ? undefined: mdTransitionAnimation,
})
```


## Documentation

Start with [Installation](#installation). Pair this theme with [@rdlabo/ionic-theme-ios26](/ionic-theme-ios26/) when you need both platforms from one markup tree.
